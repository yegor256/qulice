/**
 * Checks for not using concatenation of string literals in any form.
 *
 * <p>The following constructs are prohibited:
 *
 * <pre>
 * String a = "done in " + time + " seconds";
 * System.out.println("File not found: " + file);
 * x += "done";
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>You should avoid string concatenation at all cost. Why? There are two
 * reasons: readability of the code and translateability. First of all it's
 * difficult to understand how the text will look after concatenation,
 * especially if the text is long and there are more than a few {@code +}
 * operators. Second, you won't be able to translate your text to other
 * languages later, if you don't have solid string literals.
 *
 * <p>There are two alternatives to concatenation: {@link StringBuilder}
 * and {@link String#format(String,Object[])}.
