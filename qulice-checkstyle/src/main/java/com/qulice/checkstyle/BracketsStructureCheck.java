/**
 * Checks node/closing brackets to be the last symbols on the line.
 *
 * <p>This is how a correct bracket structure should look like:
 *
 * <pre>
 * String text = String.format(
 *   "some text: %s",
 *   new Foo().with(
 *     "abc",
 *     "foo"
 *   )
 * );
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The motivation for such formatting is simple - we want to see the entire
 * block as fast as possible. When you look at a block of code you should be
 * able to see where it starts and where it ends. In exactly the same way
 * we organize curled brackets.
 *
 * <p>In other words, when you open a bracket and can't close it at the same
 * line - you should leave it as the last symbol at this line.
