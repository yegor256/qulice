/**
 * Check for empty lines inside methods and constructors.
 *
 * <p>We believe that comments and empty lines are evil. If you need to use
 * an empty line in order to add a vertical separator of concepts - refactor
 * your code and make it more cohesive and readable. The bottom line is
 * that every method should look solid and do just <b>one thing</b>.
 *
 * This class is thread safe. It relies on building a list of line ranges by
 * visiting each method definition and each anonymous inner type. It stores
 * these references in a non-static thread local.
