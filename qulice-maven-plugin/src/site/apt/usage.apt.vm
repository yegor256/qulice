Usage

  It's easy:

+--
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>com.qulice</groupId>
      <artifactId>qulice-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>${project.version}</version>
      <configuration>
        <license>file:${basedir}/LICENSE.txt</license>
      </configuration>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <goals>
            <goal>check</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
+--

  Pay attention to the <<<license>>> configuration parameter. It is mandatory
  and has to be provided, or else the default value will be used
  (<<<./LICENSE.txt>>>). You can refer to a file with <<<file:>>> prefix, as
  in the example above. Or you can refer to a resource from classpath (very
  useful when you want to keep your license in a dedicated child module.

  License text file should contain just text. Qulice converts this file to
  proper format and compares it with your source code file headers. For example,
  this is your <<<LICENSE.txt>>>:

+--
Copyright (c) 2011-2018, Qulice.com

modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions
are met: no conditions.

  This is what your Java sources should start from:

* Multi-Module Setup

  In a multi-module setup we recommend you to move all supplementary
  resource (assemblies, XML configurations, etc) to a separate "tool kit"
  sub-module. This module is the best place for <<<LICENSE.txt>>> file:

+--
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>com.qulice</groupId>
      <artifactId>qulice-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>${project.version}</version>
      <configuration>
        <license>LICENSE.txt</license>
      </configuration>
      <dependencies>
        <dependency>
          <!-- this is your tool kit module -->
          <groupId>com.example</groupId>
          <artifactId>foo</artifactId>
          <version>0.1.2</version>
        </dependency>
      </dependencies>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <goals>
            <goal>check</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
+--

* Cutting Edge Version

  If you want to use current version of the product, you can do it with
  this configuration in your <<<pom.xml>>>:

+--
<pluginRepositories>
  <pluginRepository>
    <id>oss.sonatype.org</id>
    <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>
  </pluginRepository>
</pluginRepositories>
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>com.qulice</groupId>
      <artifactId>qulice-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
      [...]
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
