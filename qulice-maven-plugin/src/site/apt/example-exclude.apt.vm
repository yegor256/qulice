Exclude

  You can exclude anything, using plugin configuration:

+--
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>com.qulice</groupId>
      <artifactId>qulice-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>${project.version}</version>
      <configuration>
        <excludes>
          <exclude>checkstyle:/src/examples/.*</exclude>
          <exclude>findbugs:~com.qulice.foo.*</exclude>
          <exclude>findbugs:com.qulice.bar.Baz</exclude>
        </excludes>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
+--

  Every <<<exclude>>> item is a regular expression. The following
  exclusion prefixes are supported now (the list may actually be longer):
  <<<checkstyle:>>>, <<<pmd:>>>, <<<findbugs:>>>,
  <<<dependencies:>>>, <<<cobertura:>>>, <<<duplicatefinder:>>>.

  Exclude for Findbug is a bit different, as expression has to be either an
  exact class name or start with the ~ character the rest of content is
  interpreted as a Java regular expression. For example:
  1) <<<findbugs:~com.qulice.foo.*>>> excludes all classes in package
  com.qulice.foo;
  2) <<<findbugs:com.qulice.foo.Bar>>> excludes only class Bar in appropriate
  packages.
  See http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/manual/filter.html

  Dependencies exclude uses syntax of groupId:artifactId, so to exclude e.g.
  guava library you should add <<<dependencies:com.google.guava:guava>>> as an
  exclude. Multiple exclude tags can be provided to exclude multiple
  dependencies. To exclude all dependency checks <<<dependencies:.*>>> should
  be used.
